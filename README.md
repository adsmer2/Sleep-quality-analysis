# Sleep-quality-analysis
Ever wonder why you don't feel refreshed after a long night of sleep? Me too! Here I attempt to understand how some habits influence my sleep.

I used my apple watch over the course of several months to collect sleep quality data using the Autosleep app on the Apple App Store. Additionally, for each day, I recorded some of my activities of that day (e.g., did I work out? did I eat before bed?). Do any of these activities affect the quality of my sleep? I want to know what are bad habits and what I should continue doing.

I used Rstudio to perform ANOVA on these data. Using ANOVA, I identified the affect of each different factor on my sleep quality and whether that effect is statistically significant. Further, I visualize this data to be capture attention and explain my results.
